Ping Pong Game
This is a simple Ping Pong game built using Python's turtle graphics. The game features two paddles controlled by the keyboard, with a ball bouncing between them. The goal is to score by getting the ball past your opponent's paddle. The game keeps track of scores and ends when a player reaches 10 points.

Features:
Player 1 controls the left paddle using the W and S keys.
Player 2 controls the right paddle using the Up and Down arrow keys.
Ball speed increases slightly with each paddle hit.
The first player to reach 10 points wins.
